My name is Luke Bailey. I am a computer science student at 
Harvard College. I grew up in Northern England and enjoy
hiking and climbing. I am a leader of the Harvard 
outing club and mountaineering club . If you like this website, consider 
starring the [Hugo Github repository](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo) 
which I used to make it.
