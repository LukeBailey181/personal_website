## Stochastic Inc Software Engineer
### 09/2020 - 09/2021
During a leave from Harvard I worked full time as a Software Engineer for Stochastic Inc. 
1. Implementing collapsed Gibbs sampling and simulated FPGA hardware in C++ to determine the accuracy of hardware. 
2. Work from bullet 1 was part of wider research conducted concerning accelerating bayesian learning algorithms. This
research has been submitted to the HPCA Conference for peer-reviewed publication of which I am a co-author. 
2. Created flexible Python package for accelorating transformer models
using attention-head pruning, integer quantization and optimized runtimes. Used Pytorch and ONNX. Created docker containers to run
package. 
3. Worked on a web application that utilizes the above natural language processing library. Used fastAPI backend that
accepted transformer models, optimized them and returned the optimized model to the user. Also wrote a user facing
Python package to streamline the model sending and receiving process. 
4. Used Sklern and custom LDA package to create sentiment analysis pipeline that achieved exceptionally high 
accuracies with sparsely labelled data.
4. Line managed two summer interns.

## Harvard University Lichtman Lab Research Assistant
### 10/2020 - 09/2021
Working part time in the Lichtman lab to analyse brain tissue network structures - coauthored human 
connectomics [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.05.29.446289v2), currently submitted 
to Nature and under peer review. Used RANSAC regression, SVM models and other machine learning techniques 
to create novel way of categorizing brain cells into different cortical layers, implemented using Python. 
Additionally used a combination of Python and C++ to analyse motifs and multi-node structures present in
brain tissue using the Kavosh algorithm.

## Stochastic Inc Software Engineering Summer Intern
### 05/2020 - 09/2020
Working on the machine learning team to help produce a natural language processing Python package and 
running experiments to determine package performance.

1. Used C++ to help write optimized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm.
2. Used Boost Python to wrap C++ code within a Python package.
3. Benchmarked LDA package performance on various AWS EC2 instances and achieved state of the art runtimes, beating
competitors such as Gensim and MALLET by significant margins.
